# Engineering Faculty Labs

Child theme for [Flat Bootstrap](http://xtremelysocial.com/wordpress/flat/), Engineering Faculty Labs gives faculty members the ability to easily create high-quality content for their labs.

## Where in the world can I find this Engineering Faculty Labs theme?

This theme is strategically tucked away in the electronic vaults of [VCU&rsquo;s ALT Lab](http://altlab.vcu.edu/), so only the fine folks working for VCU&rsquo;s School of Engineering can partake in its beauty.

## So how do I get it?

First, you will need to have created an account on the ALT Lab hosted WordPress server, [https://rampages.us/](https://rampages.us/).

Second, you will need to send an email to Ken Kim <[kimkd@vcu.edu](mailto:kimkd@vcu.edu)> with the following information:

* Your VCU email address (Yes, this seems redundant, but it&rsquo;s completely necessary.)
* The URL of your blog/website
* Whether you want to make this theme your *active theme* or just *make it available in your theme list* 

We know the last thing you want to do right now is wait for a go-ahead response, so let&rsquo;s not do that. Now is as good of a time as any to brush up on those WordPress skills with some [lynda.com](https://lynda.com) videos like this one: [WordPress Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/WordPress-tutorials/WordPress-Essential-Training/372542-2.html).

## I have access to the theme; now what?

Congratulations! Now the fun begins.

Go ahead and log in to your [Ram Pages Dashboard](https://rampages.us/wp-admin/) and navigate to your site&rsquo;s WordPress dashboard. From here, navigate to `Appearance -> Themes.` If you requested the theme to be made available in your list, perform a page search (that&rsquo;s `Ctrl+F` for you Windows folks) for `Engineering Faculty Labs` and click the respective `Live Preview` button. If you went all-in on the theme and already have it activated, you&rsquo;ll find it in the first position with a `Customize` button. Go ahead and click that.

### The Customizer

This is where all of the theme magic happens. You can set information about your website and how it relates to the School of Engineering from the `Site Identity` subsection, match your department&rsquo;s colors from the `Colors` subsection and personalize what goes in the sidebar, footer and callout areas from the `Widgets` subsection.

#### Widgets

Speaking of personalizing callout areas, by default this theme shows an example of what you can do with the `Page Bottom` widget area. If you don&rsquo;t care to show off the example to your visitors, add a blank *Text* widget to it. On the other hand, if you like it, add a *Custom HTML* widget, give it a title, then copy and paste the following code snippet into the *Content* input area and edit how you see fit:

```html
<p>
  This is just an example shown for the theme preview.
  You can add text widgets here to put whatever you&rsquo;d like.
</p>
<a href="https://vcu.edu" class="btn btn-hollow btn-lg">
  Call To Action Button
</a>
```

Take a look at your sidebar in the preview pane. Now click into the `EGR Sidebar (custom)` widget area. You&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s nothing there, yet there&rsquo;s a search bar and your email address in the preview pane?!? Well, we used a little bit of that theme magic to make it happen. If you don&rsquo;t like your email address front and center, add a *Text* widget and either leave it blank or populate it how you see fit.
